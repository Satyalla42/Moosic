# üéß Moosic ‚Äì Clustering Your Vibes

Can a machine learn taste in music?

**Moosic** is an experimental project that uses unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering) to analyze and group songs based on audio features ‚Äì then auto-generates playlists on Spotify that match the vibe. The real question: can an algorithm beat your ears?

## üöÄ Features

- üîç **Fetch tracks** from a Spotify playlist, saved tracks, or user listening history
- üìä **Extract audio features** via Spotify's Web API (e.g. danceability, energy, tempo)
- ü§ñ **Cluster tracks** using K-Means into mood-based or feature-based groups
- üéµ **Generate new playlists** for each cluster and upload them to your Spotify account
- üëÇ **Compare machine clusters vs. human taste** ‚Äì can the algorithm predict your musical mood?

## üß† How It Works

1. **Authenticate** with your Spotify account (OAuth2)
2. **Collect songs** and extract their audio features using the Spotify API
3. **Normalize features** and apply K-Means clustering
4. **Group tracks** by cluster and label them (optional)
5. **Create playlists** on your Spotify with one click

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- `spotipy` ‚Äì Spotify API wrapper
- `scikit-learn` ‚Äì for K-Means clustering
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` ‚Äì for data wrangling and visualization

## üß™ Example Use Case

Cluster your liked songs into 4 groups:
```bash
python moosic.py --source liked --clusters 4
